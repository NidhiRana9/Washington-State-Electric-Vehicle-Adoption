# Washington-State-Electric-Vehicle-Adoption
🚀 Washington State Electric Vehicle Adoption | Power BI Dashboard Project



As a student exploring data analytics and business intelligence, I designed and developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze Electric Vehicle (EV) adoption trends in Washington State, focusing on Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs).

This project pushed me to think beyond charts, emphasizing storytelling, usability, and real-world decision support through data.

🔍 Through this project, I worked on:

a) Designing a multi-page dashboard with a modern, consistent visual theme and intuitive layout

 b) Analyzing EV adoption growth over time, including BEV vs PHEV trends

 c) Visualizing geographic distribution of EVs across state, county, and city levels

 d) Exploring vehicle & brand insights, including top manufacturers and average electric range

 e) Assessing policy and utility factors, such as Clean Alternative Fuel eligibility and electric utility coverage

 f) Enabling interactive exploration using slicers, filters, and drill-downs for deeper insights



This project significantly strengthened my understanding of how Power BI, data modeling, and thoughtful design can support policy planning, infrastructure decisions, and sustainability initiatives.
